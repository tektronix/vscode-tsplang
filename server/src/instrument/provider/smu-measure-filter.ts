\n\
Get or set the present averaging filter type to smu.FILTER_\\*. Defaults to smu.FILTER_REPEAT_AVG.\n\
\n\
When set to smu.FILTER_REPEAT_AVG, a set of measurements are made and stored in a stack of the size defined by the \
filter count setting. These stack measurements are averaged together to produce a final measurement, after which all \
stack items are removed and the process repeated. This type of filter is the slowest, as the stack must be filled \
before an averaged sample can be produced.\n\
\n\
When set to smu.FILTER_MOVING_AVG, a set of measurements are made and stored in a first-in, first-out queue the size \
of which is defined by the filter count setting. The moving average filter type does not wait for all measurements \
from the previous average to clear the queue before providing another, should it be requested. However, the queue \
must be filled before any averaging takes place.\n\

This attribute is saved with the active function and retained until the next instrument reset or power cycle.'
