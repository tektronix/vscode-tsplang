Only used when the math format attribute is set to smu.MATH_PERCENT.\n\

Percent deviation is calculated as `percent = ((in - ref) / ref) * 100` where \
*percent* is the supplied measurment result, \
*in* is the measurement with relative offset applied (if applicable), \
and *ref* is this attribute.\n\
