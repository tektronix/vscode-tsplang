\n\
Get or set a number from 0 to 253 that, in binary, represents the Status Enable (ESE) register of the Standard Event \
Register (ESR). The value is the binary sum of all bits set in the register.\n\
\n\
When a bit in the ESE and its corresponding ESR bit is set, the Event Summary Bit (ESB) of the Status Byte (STB) \
register is also set. The ESE register is cleared when set to 0.\n\
\n\
From right to left, each bit represents the following: \
*B0* — Operation Complete (OPC), \
*B1* — not used, \
*B2* — Query Error (QYE), \
*B3* — Device-Dependent Error (DDE), \
*B4* — Execution Error (EXE), \
*B5* — Command Error (CME), \
*B6* — User Request (URQ), \
and *B7* — Power On (PON).\n\
\n\
QYE indicates an attempt to read data from an empty Output Queue. DDE indicates the instrument operation did not \
execute properly due to an internal condition. EXE indicates the instrument detected an error while trying to execute \
a command. CMD can represent a IEEE 488.2 syntax error (received message was malformed), semantic error (received \
message was misspelled or is not implemented), or a GET error (received a Group Execute Trigger [GET] inside a \
program message). URQ indicates the instrument transitioned from remote to local control. PON indicates the \
instrument has been power cycled since the last ESE query.\n\
\n\
For example, a return value of 129 can be represented as 1000 0001, where B0 and B7 are enabled. This indicates that \
the OPC (1) and PON (129) registers are set.'
