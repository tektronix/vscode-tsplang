        documentation: {

            value: '```lua\nfunction clear()\n```\n\
\n\
Clear the event log and the Questionable Event and Operation Event registers.\n\
\n\
Does not affect the Questionable Event Enable or Operation Event Enable registers.'

\n\
Returns a number from 0 to 253 that, in binary, represents the Status Byte (STB) register. The value \
is the binary sum of all bits set in the register.\n\
\n\
When an enabled event occurs, its associated Status bit is set to 1. From right to left, each bit represents the \
following: \
*B0* — Measurement Summary Bit (MSB), \
*B1* — not used, \
*B2* — Error Available (EAV), \
*B3* — Questionable Summary Bit (QSB), \
*B4* — Message Available (MAV), \
*B5* — Event Summary Bit (ESB), \
*B6* — Master Summary Status (MSS), \
and *B7* — Operation Summary Bit (OSB).\n\
\n\
For example, a return value of 129 can be represented as 1000 0001, where B0 and B7 are enabled. This indicates that \
the MSB (1) and OSB (129) registers are set.\n\
\n\
If using the GPIB, USB, or VXI-11 serial poll sequence to retrieve the status byte (also called a serial poll byte), \
then B6 is the Request for Service (RQS) bit. When set, it indicates that a serial poll request (SRQ) has occurred.'

\n\
Reset all event and enable registers for Operation and Questionable.\n\
\n\
Does not affect the event queue or the Service Request Enable (SRE), Standard Request Enable (ESE), or Standard \
Event Status (ESR) registers.'

\n\
Get or set a number from 0 to 189 that, in binary, represents the Service Request Enable (SRE) register. The value \
is the binary sum of all bits set in the register.\n\
\n\
The SRE register is cleared when power is cycled or when set to 0.\n\
\n\
When an enabled event occurs, its associated SRE bit is set to 1. From right to left, each bit represents the \
following: \
*B0* — Measurement Summary Bit (MSB), \
*B1* — not used, \
*B2* — Error Available (EAV), \
*B3* — Questionable Summary Bit (QSB), \
*B4* — Message Available (MAV), \
*B5* — Event Summary Bit (ESB), \
*B6* — not used, \
and *B7* — Operation Summary Bit (OSB).\n\
\n\
For example, a return value of 129 can be represented as 1000 0001, where B0 and B7 are enabled. This indicates that \
the MSB (1) and OSB (129) registers are set.'
