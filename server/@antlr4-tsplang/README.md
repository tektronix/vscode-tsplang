# ANTLR4-TSPLang

This package exposes:
* classes generated by ANTLR4 from the TSP grammar file.
* types that extend ANTLR4 lexing and parsing functionality.

## Requirements

See [Getting Started with ANTLR v4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md) for detailed setup instructions.

The following is required to compile the TSP grammar:
* Java Development Kit (v1.6+).
* The antlr complete jar file.
* The environment variable `CLASSPATH`, which should contain two directories:
  * `.` (the currect working directory).
  * The absolute path to the antlr jar file.
