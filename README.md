The TSP language extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) provides command completions for [supported](#supported-instruments) TSP-enabled Keithley Instruments.

## Requirements

To enable TSP command completions for supported instruments, a shebang line is required. TSP shebangs take the form of
```
--#!<model>
```
where `<model>` is a supported instrument model. Shebangs __must__ be placed on the first line of a file with a `.tsp` extension.

After installation, if you have not restarted VSCode, you may have to manually select the TSP language for your files. By default, this can be done by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd><kbd>K</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd> on Mac and selecting "TSP" while editing your file.

## Supported Instruments

Release builds are available as VSIX files in the [Releases](https://github.com/tektronix/vscode-tsplang/releases) section. Currently supported instrument models include:
* 2450
